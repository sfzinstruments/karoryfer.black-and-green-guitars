# Black And Green Guitars

Black And Green Guitars is a free sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.971 or newer. It contains samples of a green Gretsch Anniversary and a black Hofner Club, recorded and photographed by Brian Wood.

## Usage

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Black And Green Guitars.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

## Issues

The bank XML may be broken and unable to register in Plogue Sforzando properly if downloaded from Github via the "Code" button. The XML should be 2692 bytes in order for the digital signature to be correct, but when downloaded and extracted it's 2638 bytes. Downloading from the Releases section is safe, though. On Windows systems it's also apparently possible to copy-paste the contents into a new file in Notepad, save it, and get a file of the correct size.
